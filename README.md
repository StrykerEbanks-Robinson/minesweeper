# Minesweeper
This is a Minesweeper game that I built mostly because my fiance really likes minesweeper!

## Special Thanks
I watched [Kylie Ying](https://github.com/kying18/)'s YouTube video, [12 Beginner Python Projects - Coding Course](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg), for help with the recursive 'digging' function in this game.
